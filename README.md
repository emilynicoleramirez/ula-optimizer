# ULA Optimization Tool

This interactive tool models how different United to House LA (ULA) loan limits affect the feasibility and impact of affordable housing developments in the City of Los Angeles.

## What It Does

The tool allows users to adjust:

- ULA loan limit (% of total development cost)  
- Total available ULA revenue

And instantly see how those inputs influence:

- Total per-unit development cost  
- Additional state funding unlocked  
- Monthly interest savings from reduced debt  
- Project delivery timelines  
- Total funds for Alternative Models + Multifamily Production

## Why It Matters

One of the biggest decisions facing the implementation of ULA is how deeply to loan these funds into projects. Higher loan limits may reduce project financing complexity and unlock additional public dollars — but could also limit how many projects are funded overall.

This tool is designed to inform that tradeoff.

## Data & Assumptions

This tool is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of five years of award data for Los Angeles City projects that received state and federal funding, including LIHTC (9% and 4%), AHSC, MHP, VHHP, FWHG, and IIG. It also incorporates insights from HCD’s universal scoring criteria, interviews with investors regarding average market interest rates for conventional loans, and peer feedback from SCANPH’s extensive network of affordable housing developers and finance professionals.
